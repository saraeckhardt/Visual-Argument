# Visual-Argument
I plan to address the issue of overconsumption with my visual argument, in a web-based format. In the modern digital age, we are constantly presented with ads for incredibly cheap products from companies like Shein, Temu, and Tiktok Shop. Not only are these products unethically sourced, they inevitably end up in the trash, creating an excess of garbage in landfills that harm the environment through greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater contamination, and many other detrimental effects. The target audience for this piece would be adults with internet access and disposable finances, especially those who frequently use the internet and social media. I feel like this piece will have to be pretty pointed and jarring, as many of those who participate in these fast-fashion/cheap product trends most likely do not even think about or care about the negative impacts they are causing. I am thinking of taking a “is it worth it?” approach, using contrasting images of the products and their deteriorated forms in landfills/negative effects of landfills like the death of animals from groundwater contamination or landfill fires, perhaps even something along the lines of “the life cycle of a Temu product” ending with a grotesque image of an overflowing dump. The end product will have to be attention-grabbing and direct to get the point across and hopefully cause an emotional reaction that persuades viewers to make a change in their consumption habits.
